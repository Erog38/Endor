transmitter for the Death Star. (MK 2)

## Internet Radio Streaming in Golang

This is the repo for my personal internet radio streaming website eventually
located at https://radio.philgore.net/

## Backend

Using flat files, and a network connected file share, this server will hold
a queue of file handlers with one song being played, and one being loaded into
a buffer.

## Frontend

The frontend for this project should consist of a featured website, including
song request out of a preselected library, and a webclient which can play
music from the server. 

The stream should also be available from an industry standard player, such as
VLC, iTunes, Winamp, etc.
